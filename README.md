## About You're Trippin'
You're Trippin' is a user-focused web application where users will create an account, where they will select their activity preferences of choice. From their account, a user can create a schedule by typing what they will be doing and a start & end time. The schedule will be displayed for users to keep track of what they want to do for that day. In addition, we were planning on populating the activity pages with data we obtained using the Yelp API. Unfortunately, at the time of this document being typed up, we were unable to obtain data from the Yelp API, so there is no data for those pages.

## The Motivation behind the project
We were inspired by the various other travel websites, but felt it was limited for users. Most travel websites felt too curated on what a tourist "should" do and not what their personal interests are. To remedy this, we thought adding a personal itinerary where users can create their own schedule and set their own times would give users more freedom. Though having an open-ended schedule creation tool would be too much freedom for some, so we also included an activities page for them to browse through. The activities page is split up into six unique categories, which would narrow down the choices the user has and let them decide what their dream vacation looks like.
